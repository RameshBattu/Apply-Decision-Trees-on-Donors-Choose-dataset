<hr>

- Understanding the Businessreal world problem

- Loading the data

- Preprocessing the data(based on the type of data = categorical , text, Numarical )

- Preprocessing data includes (removing outliers, impute missung values, cleaning data, remove spacial character, etc..)

- Split the data into train, cv, test(random splitting)

- Vectorization data ( one hot encoding)

- Vectorizing text data(bow, tfidf,  avgw2v, tfidf weighted w2v)

- Vectorizing numarical - Normalizer 

- Applying Desition Trees Model on top of the features 

- Contactinating all the type of features(cat + num + selected text features)

- Hyperparameter tuning to find th best estimator(GridSearchCV) and Ploting heatmaps

- Train the Desition Trees Model using best hyperparameter and ploting auc roc-curve

- Ploting confusion matrix(heatmaps)

- Graphviz visualization of Decision Tree

- Finding the False Possitive points

- Ploting wordcloud with the words of essay text of these false positive data points

- Ploting Box plot with price of false possitive points

- PDF & CDF with teacher_number_of_previously_posted_projects false possitive points

- Getting top 5k features using feature_importances_with TFIDF

- Hyperparameter tuning to find th best estimator(GridSearchCV) and Ploting heatmaps

- Train the Desition Trees Model using best hyperparameter and ploting auc roc-curve

- Ploting confusion matrix(heatmaps)

- Graphviz visualization of Decision Tree

- Finding the False Possitive points

- Ploting wordcloud with the words of essay text of these false positive data points

- Ploting Box plot with price of false possitive points

- PDF & CDF with teacher_number_of_previously_posted_projects false possitive points

- Observation on overall model performences(Conclusion)

- Ploting the performences by table format.
